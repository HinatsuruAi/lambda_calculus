lambda_calculus
===================
A lambda_calculus library with various feature.

Feature:
===================
 - A praser generator that can generate praser that can prase certain Combinatory Logic code (TMP)
 - Prasers of BCKW and Iota using praser generator (TMP)
 - Church Numeral (TMP)
 - Church Numeral and Boolean logic Interface to C++ TMP code
 - Propositional logic (TMP)
 - combinator calculus (TMP)
 - Data Structure such as list and pair (TMP)
 - The Y combinator (TMP)
 - Ability to convert TMP lambda calculus code into Runtime lambda calculus object.
 - Printing, Sorting and Testing for equality of Runtime lambda calculus object.

Build and Dependency:
===================
 - Header Only.
 - Need Boost.
 - Need -std=c++1z.
